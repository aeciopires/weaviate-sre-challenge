- Configure authentication on your Github account to use the SSH protocol instead of HTTP. Watch this tutorial to learn how to set up: https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account
- [OPTIONAL] Install all packages and binaries following this [tutorial](REQUIREMENTS.md).

- Create a fork this repository.
- Clone the forked repository to your local system:

```bash
git clone FORKED_REPOSITORY
```

- Add the address for the remote original repository:

```bash
git remote -v
git remote add upstream git@github.com:aeciopires/weaviate-sre-challenge.git
git remote -v
```

- Configure your profile:

```bash
git config --local user.email "you@example.com"

git config --local user.name "Your Name"
```

- Create a branch. Example:

```bash
git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME
```

- Make sure you are on the correct branch using the following command. The branch in use contains the '*' before the name.

```bash
git branch
```

- Make your changes and tests to the new branch.

- Commit the changes to the branch.
- Push files to repository remote with command:

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin BRANCH_NAME
```

- Create Pull Request (PR) to the `main` branch. See this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)
- Update the content with the suggestions of the reviewer (if necessary).
- After your pull request is merged to the `main` branch, update your local clone:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
```

- Clean up after your pull request is merged with command:

```bash
git branch -d BRANCH_NAME
```

- Then you can update the ``main`` branch in your forked repository.

```bash
git push origin main
```

- And push the deletion of the feature branch to your GitHub repository with command:

```bash
git push --delete origin BRANCH_NAME
```

- To keep your fork in sync with the original repository, use these commands:

```bash
git pull upstream main
git push origin main
```
